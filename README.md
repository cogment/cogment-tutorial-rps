# Cogment "Rock Paper Scissors" demo

ðŸš§

## Dependencies

This project relies on **v1.0.0-alpha1** of `cogment-orchestrator`, `cogment-cli` and `cogment-py-sdk` which haven't been released yet. Local version of those, from their respective `develop` branch, are expected to be available.

### `cogment-cli`

#### Local binaries

Build local binaries using the following in a locally checked out cogment-cli directory.

```
make release
```

This will build the binaries for each platform in `./build` you should then alias `cogment` to the relevant one. e.g.

```
alias cogment="$(pwd)/build/cogment-macOS-amd64"
```

#### Docker build

Build docker iamge using the following in a locally checked out cogment-cli directory.

```
docker build --tag ai-r/cogment-cli:v1.0.0-alpha1 .
```

This will build the docker image you can alias it to `cogment` for simpler usage. e.g.

```
alias cogment="docker run --rm -v$(pwd):/cogment -v/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ai-r/cogment-cli:v1.0.0-alpha1"
```

### `cogment-orchestrator`

Make sure you retrieve the latest `develop` build

```
docker pull registry.gitlab.com/ai-r/cogment-orchestrator:latest
```

### `cogment-py-sdk`

Build a local docker tag using the following in a locally checked out cogment-py-sdk directory.

```
docker build -t cogment/cogment-py-sdk:v1.0.0-alpha1 .
```
